				<h2>What are the claims?</h2><hr>

				  <p>
                        The claim is that consuming artificial sweetener can give you cancer.
                        Why so?<br/>
                        Artificial sweetener contains chemicals like <strong>sucralose</strong> or <strong>aspartame</strong>
                        that are meant to replicate the same taste of regular sugar without actually gaining the calories.

                        Typically, a can or bottle of soda will contain around 100 calories and 40-80 grams of sugar. In one
                        serving of soda, you will have exceeded your recommended daily sugar intake (which should be less than 40).
                        Lots of soda brands have versions of their drink like diet coke and coke zero. In addition, there are many
                        brands that sell artificial sweetener in little packets. Access to artificial sugar is as easy as regular sugar. A lot of stores sell them. Additionally, there is a lot of advertisements going towards them, such as weight loss and healthy eating programs.

				<h1>Dangers of Sugar</h1><hr>
				<p>
					Consuming a lot of regular sugar can cause heart disease, whether overweight or not. It doesn't matter the body type, anyone can get the disease. The one of the obvious ways to prevent heart disease is by reducing the sugar in your diet. However, a lot of food and drinks contain sugar, making it hard to escape from it. In fact, one-third of all consumed sugar in the United States comes from sugar filled drinks, like soda and juices.In a fifteen year Harvard study, people who consumed 25% more calories from sugar were two times more likely to die from heart disease.

					One of the reasons people may perfer artificial sweetener over regular sugar is that it gives empty calories. These types of calories don't have any vitamins or nutrients. It means that you gain calories without any benefits. Artificial sweeteners don't give any calories at all. The other reason that regular sugar is undesirable is that it can cause to weight gain and also leads to cavities if you don't take care of your teeth.
