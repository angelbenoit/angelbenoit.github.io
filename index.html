				<h2>What are the claims?</h2><hr>

				  <p>
                        The claim is that consuming artificial sweetener can give you cancer.
                        Why so?<br/>
                        Artificial sweetener contains chemicals like <strong>sucralose</strong> or <strong>aspartame</strong>
                        that are meant to replicate the same taste of regular sugar without actually gaining the calories.
                    </p>

                        Typically, a can or bottle of soda will contain around 100 calories and 40-80 grams of sugar. In one
                        serving of soda, you will have exceeded your recommended daily sugar intake (which should be less than 40).
                        Lots of soda brands have versions of their drink like diet coke and coke zero. In addition, there are many
                        brands that sell artificial sweetener in little packets. Access to artificial sugar is as easy as regular sugar. A lot of stores sell them. Additionally, there is a lot of advertisements going towards them, such as weight loss and healthy eating programs.

					Why People Choose Artificial Sweeteners
				</h1><br>
				<div class="benefits-p">
					<p>
						One of the main reasons people consume artificial sweetener over regular sugar is the health benefits. Consuming a lot of regular sugar can lead to diabetes and weight gain, as it contains calories. In fact, artificial sweetener is sweeter than regular sugar. Seems too good to be true, has no calories and tastes better?
